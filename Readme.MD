## Miniatures

This is a repositort that I maintain mainly for learning purpose.
I have minitature projects in this that help me learn new and core concepts.

## Main Learnings :

- Interval and timeout difference. Interval fires the function after every interval.
- e.currentTarget targets the element that is responsible for handling the event and
  not the sub elements.

## Relay implementations 
Relay Environment, queries, and fragments
